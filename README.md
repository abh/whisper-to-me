# Graphite Charts Without the Graphite App

![Graphite without Graphite](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2701/Screenshots/whisper-to-me.png)

[Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org) is kind of insane to setup, in particular all the nonsense around Cairo and
PyCairo. What. A. Pain. But the back-end (Carbon and Whisper) is easy to setup and works as advertised.

So I decided to see if I can use [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) to draw SVG charts directly from the
[Whisper](http://graphite.wikidot.com/whisper) files generated by the Graphite back-end (Carbon).

Famout last words.

But it worked. Good enough for playing with charts, and an awesome JavaScript learning experience. (Yes, I optimize my
free time for that)

So skip the Graphite Web app and get Carbon and Whisper installed:

    $ sudo pip install whisper
    $ sudo pip install carbon
    $ cp /opt/graphite/conf/carbon.conf.example /opt/graphite/conf/carbon.conf
    $ cp /opt/graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf.example /opt/graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf
 
Fire up Carbon and start collecting data:  

    $ /opt/graphite/bin/carbon-cache.py start

Now run the Web server:

    $ npm start
    $ open localhost:8080

If your machine stores Whisper files in any other directory, you need to tell the server where to look by setting the
environment variable `GRAPHITE_STORAGE`.  The default path is `/opt/graphite/storage`.

Enjoy.

**Note** This is an experiment more than anything. Some
[functions](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/functions.html) are implemented, most not, neither are date ranges.
But if you like to hack on it, be my guest.
